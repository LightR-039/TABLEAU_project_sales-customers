# 📊 Sales & Customer Dashboards (Tableau)

## Problem Statement

Sales and marketing teams need a clear way to monitor **year-over-year performance**, identify **sales and profit trends**, and understand **customer behavior** across products and regions.
This project converts raw transactional data (2020–2023) into **stakeholder-ready Tableau dashboards** to support data-driven decision-making.

* **Time Period:** 2020–2023
* **Focus Year (Dashboard View):** 2023
* **Target Users:** Sales managers, executives, marketing teams

* Customer KPIs: **Total Customers, Sales per Customer, Orders**
* Monthly customer trends with YoY comparison
* Customer distribution by **number of orders**
* **Top 10 customers by profit**, including order count and recency

---

## Key Insights (2023)

* **Strong YoY Growth:** Sales, profit, quantity, and total orders all increased compared to 2022, indicating overall business growth.
* **Seasonality Identified:** Both sales and customer activity peaked toward the end of the year, highlighting seasonal demand patterns.
* **Profit ≠ Sales:** Some product subcategories generated high sales but relatively lower profits, emphasizing the importance of margin analysis.
* **Customer Concentration:** A small group of high-value customers contributed a disproportionate share of total profit.
* **Engagement Pattern:** Most customers placed 1–3 orders, while repeat customers (4+ orders) represent a smaller but valuable segment.
